## Reflection

I wanted to build an application that would allow users to save all their favorite recipes, so that paper notebooks are no longer needed. No risk of losing it, no risk of spilling wine all over it, always easy to access.

I decided to use what I have learned about React, while looking for new solutions on the way. I included the authentication and storage features by using Firebase. The app itself was initialized using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.
