## Recipe Saver

Web application allowing users to save their recipes (ingredients, steps, image) once authenticated. Built with React.

## Project Status

This project is currently in development. Users can access their recipes by choosing items from the list. Functionality to add list categories to be added.

## Summary

I wanted to build an application that would allow users to save all their favorite recipes, so that paper notebooks are no longer needed. No risk of losing it, no risk of spilling wine all over it, always easy to access.

I decided to use what I have learned about React, while looking for new solutions on the way. I included the authentication and storage features by using Firebase. The app itself was initialized using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.
