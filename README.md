## Recipe Saver

Web application allowing users to save their recipes (ingredients, steps, image) once authenticated. The users can access their recipes by choosing items from their list. Built with React.

## Summary

I wanted to build an application that would allow users to save all their favorite recipes, so that paper notebooks are no longer needed. No risk of losing it, no risk of spilling wine all over it, always easy to access.

I decided to use what I have learned about React, while looking for new solutions on the way. I included the authentication and storage features by using Firebase. The app itself was initialized using the `create-react-app` boilerplate.
